# Gisida API
This is a REST API (Node / Express) for Ona's [Gisida](http://gisida.onalabs.org/) visualization library. It provides user authentication (AWS Cognito) and data persistance (AWS DynamoDB) for the Gisida Editor. 


## Develop

```
npm install
```
and then:
```
node app.js
```
to start an instance of the API on port 3000.
